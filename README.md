**DOM Manipulation Projects**

This repository contains three small projects built using JavaScript DOM manipulation. I created these projects to better understand how JavaScript works with HTML and CSS to build interactive web pages.

All projects are made using plain JavaScript, without any external libraries or frameworks. The focus was on learning how to handle user interactions, update elements dynamically, and write clear, readable logic.

**What I Learned**

How to select and manipulate DOM elements

Handling events like clicks and input changes

Updating the UI based on user actions

Writing cleaner and more structured JavaScript

Improving logical thinking through hands-on practice

**Tech Stack**

HTML

CSS

JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

**Projects**

This repository includes three DOM-based projects that focus on interaction and dynamic UI updates. Each project helped me strengthen my frontend fundamentals.

**Purpose**

These projects are part of my frontend development learning journey. They helped me build a solid base in JavaScript before moving on to more advanced topics and frameworks.

More updates and improvements will be added as I continue learning.
